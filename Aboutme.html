     <h2> Who is Farrah Kimberly-Evita Jean?</h2>
     <p>Before finding my passion in web development,
       I attended the University of Massachusetts - Boston for Psychology
       and Sociology as well as Communication Studies. I was doing grassroots
       marketing with Sony Music and Cornerstone Agency and other brand
       ambassadors positions, but I was more passionate about my personal
       blog on culture and lifestyle. I enjoyed designing my blog, and became
       interested in learning more about coding. </p>

       <p>I first attended General Assembly to become a Front-End Web Developer.
         I became entranced by the possibilities of manipulating the DOM and
         creating webpages simply with HTML5 and CSS3. Then Resilient Coders helped
         me become more informed and enhanced my skills. I have found my niche with
         designing and creating an alternate universe, in which a webpage can be customized
         and built from scratch through wireframes, sheer imagination and knowledge. </p>

       <p>I enjoy bringing my unique mindset to the field, and eventually want to help
         other women of color enter this industry too. To diversify the field through
         education and paying it forward would make me feel accomplished in more ways than
         one. I am elated to accept any challenge thrown at me. I am looking to bring my
         creativity and efficiency to a progressive company that continually challenges
         me to become a better developer.</p>
